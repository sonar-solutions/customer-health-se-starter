# /personalize — Customer-Tailored Demo Flow Generator

Reads the repo's existing demo guides (the proven source of truth), pulls customer context from
Glean, validates prompts in a fresh session, and writes a focused 1-pager an SE can use live.

No separate beat library to maintain. Everything flows from the three guides:
- **`DEMO_GUIDE.md`** — full, high-maturity (Cloud); every beat tagged with a `Requires:` marker
- **`WORKSHOP_GUIDE.md`** — lite, prompts-only (Cloud)
- **`WORKSHOP_GUIDE_SQS.md`** — Server / on-prem variant

Step 5 picks which to draw from based on complexity × platform.

---

## Track → Maturity Reference (internal — do not surface to user)

| Track | When to Use |
|---|---|
| **A — Guardrails & Gates** | Any maturity. Security/compliance pain. Show hooks, CLAUDE.md, SessionStart context, before/after gate. |
| **B — AI-Assisted Dev** | Piloting AI coding tools (Copilot, Cursor, Claude). Inner loop story. Guide→Generate→Verify. |
| **C — Autonomous Agents** | Scaling AI. Team-level governance concern. `/sonar-blitz`, `/tech-debt-sprint`, `/arch-guard`. |
| **D — Custom Agent Patterns** | Platform/advanced. Building on top of Sonar. `/security-posture`, `/sonar-onboard`, `/instance-report`. |

**Simplified mode** (prompts only, no infrastructure explanation) — use when:
- Exec/CTO-only, no engineer on the call
- First call or SDR-set scope-and-probe
- Session < 20 min
- No AI tooling in their current stack

In simplified mode: show the prompt, show the output. Do not explain hooks, CLAUDE.md, or skill anatomy.

---

## Step 1 — Resolve Customer Name

Extract from args (e.g., `/personalize Payoneer` → `Payoneer`). If no name was provided, ask.
Customer folder: `~/customers/<CustomerName>/`

---

## Step 2 — Pull Customer Context

Check local files first:
- `~/customers/<CustomerName>/callprep.md`
- `~/customers/<CustomerName>/account-brief.md`

Then pull from Glean to fill gaps:
- `gmail_search`: query `"<CustomerName>"`, after 2 weeks ago
- `meeting_lookup`: query `"<CustomerName>"`, after 4 weeks ago
- `search`: query `"<CustomerName> AI code quality pain tooling"`

Extract (do not surface raw results to user):
- **Personas on the call** — role/title
- **Primary pain or stated interest** — exact quotes if available
- **AI maturity** — exploring / piloting / scaling
- **Current tooling** — IDE, CI, code quality, AI coding tools
- **Platform** — SonarQube **Cloud** or **Server** (on-prem)? Determines which guide to draw from. Default to Cloud unless on-prem / "Server" / "self-hosted" / "no Docker" signals appear.
- **Session type** — discovery, scope-and-probe, deep dive, demo
- **Session length** — if known

---

## Step 3 — Fill Gaps (max 2 AskUserQuestion calls)

Only ask what Step 2 didn't resolve. Batch unknowns per question.

**Q1** (if personas or primary pain missing):
> "Who's on the call and what's the one thing they most want to see?
> (Role + their words if you have them — exact quotes anchor the framing best)"

**Q2** (if AI maturity AND session length both missing):
> "Two quick things: How mature is this team with AI coding tools?
> (exploring / piloting / scaling) — and how long is the session?"

**Q3** (only if platform is genuinely ambiguous and it matters for tool selection):
> "Are they on SonarQube Cloud or Server (on-prem)? Server changes what's available
> (no CAG/SQAA, `sonar api` instead) and which guide I draw from."

If these are known from Glean, skip to Step 4.

---

## Step 4 — Capability Check (Glean)

Before reading the guide, search Glean for recent Sonar AI capability updates:
- `search`: `"SonarQube AI capabilities new features 2026"`
- `search`: `"SQAA sonar verify update"`
- `search`: `"Sonar MCP announcement"`

Goal: ensure what's about to be recommended reflects the current product. Note any new features
that didn't exist when the guide was last updated that might be directly relevant to this customer.
Weave these into framing if they're relevant — flag anything that's significantly different from
what the guide describes.

---

## Step 5 — Assess Complexity × Platform → Pick the Source Guide

Two independent axes from the customer profile (Steps 2-3) decide **which guide** you draw from:

**Complexity:**
- **Full story** — hooks, CLAUDE.md, skills, agents as infrastructure. The plumbing is part of the
  demo. Use for: engineers, architects, DevEx leads, AI governance stakeholders, longer sessions.
- **Simplified / lite** — prompts only. What does Claude do? What does SonarQube catch? No plumbing.
  Use for: execs, first calls, scope-and-probe, very short sessions, customers with no AI tooling.

**Platform:** Cloud or Server (on-prem).

| Platform | Complexity | Draw beats from |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud | Full | `DEMO_GUIDE.md` (any `Requires:` tag, including `skill:`/`agent:`) |
| Cloud | Lite | `WORKSHOP_GUIDE.md` — or DEMO_GUIDE beats tagged `none`/`hooks`/`mcp` only |
| Server | Either | `WORKSHOP_GUIDE_SQS.md` — avoid CAG/SQAA beats (Cloud only); prefer `sonar api` + standard MCP |

Record both decisions — they pick the guide in Step 6 and shape framing in Step 8.

---

## Step 6 — Read Source Docs & Select Beats

Read the guide(s) chosen in Step 5:
- `DEMO_GUIDE.md` — full track reference; every beat carries a `> **Requires:**` tag
  (`none` / `hooks` / `mcp` / `skill:<name>` / `agent:<name>`)
- `WORKSHOP_GUIDE.md` — lite, prompts-only Cloud workshop (maturity 1-2)
- `WORKSHOP_GUIDE_SQS.md` — Server variant (`sonar api`, no Docker, CAG/SQAA caveats)

Select 2-3 specific prompts or workflows from the right track. Rules:
- **Honor the `Requires:` tags.** For a **lite** demo, pick only beats tagged `none`/`hooks`/`mcp` —
  do not select `skill:`/`agent:` beats. For **Server**, never pick CAG (`get_guidelines`) or
  SQAA (`sonar verify`) beats — they're Cloud only.
- Match the track to AI maturity (Track A=any, B=piloting, C/D=scaling)
- Lead with the prompt/workflow most directly tied to their stated pain or a verbatim customer quote
- Prompts must be verbatim from the guide — no paraphrasing
- Never pick more than 3

---

## Step 7 — Validate Prompts in Worktree

For each selected prompt, test it in a fresh session:

```bash
# Create a worktree for clean testing
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/personalize-test main

# Test each prompt (run from repo root, worktree context)
cd .claude/worktrees/personalize-test
claude -p "<prompt verbatim from guide>"
```

Check:
- Does the output match what the guide describes?
- Does it trigger the right MCP tool calls?
- Is the output something an SE can point at and explain in < 30 seconds?

**If a prompt produces unexpected output or fails:**
1. Try the closest variant from the guide
2. Re-test the variant
3. If still unclear after 2 attempts, use `AskUserQuestion`:
   > "The prompt `<prompt>` isn't producing the expected output right now.
   > Here's what I got: `<summary>`. Want to try a variation, or should I swap in a
   > different prompt for this slot?"

Clean up the worktree after all prompts are validated.

---

## Step 8 — Write Output

Create `~/customers/<CustomerName>/demos/` if needed, then write `demo-flows.md`.

```markdown
# Demo Flow: <CustomerName>
**Prepared:** <date>
**Session:** <type> (~<N> min)
**Personas:** <role 1>, <role 2>
**AI maturity:** <exploring / piloting / scaling>
**Complexity:** <full / simplified>

---

## Beat 1: <Short Name> (~<N> min)

### Setup
<Pre-prompt steps if needed — verbatim from guide. Skip section if none.>

### Prompt
```
<Exact verbatim prompt — never paraphrase>
```

### What to Watch For
<3-5 bullets from the tested output. What should Claude call/do? What should appear?>

### How to Frame It
> "<1-2 sentences using their actual words or stack where possible. Generic framing as fallback.>"
> [Full story only] "<Follow-up line pointing at the enforcement mechanism — hook, gate, etc.>"

### Next
<One sentence on where to go if they're engaged — which beat follows naturally>

---

## Beat 2: <Short Name> (~<N> min)

[same structure]

---

## Pre-Call Checklist
- [ ] On `main` branch (not `demo/bad-state`)
- [ ] MCP server connected (sonarqube visible in sidebar)
- [ ] <beat-specific items — e.g. "useProjectMetrics.ts must NOT exist" for generate-verify>
- [ ] Test lead prompt in a fresh session the morning of the call
- [ ] <customer-specific prep note if relevant>

---

## If They Ask...

**"<Likely objection or question based on their stack/context>"**
<One sentence response.>

**"<Second likely question>"**
<One sentence response.>
```

**Output rules:**
- Prompts are verbatim — copied from what was validated in Step 7
- Customer language beats generic framing — use their words
- No Snyk, TruFoundry, or tool-specific framing unless those names appeared in Glean context
- Simplified mode: omit the "How to Frame It" infrastructure line; keep framing to the output, not the plumbing

---

## Terminal Summary

After writing the file, print:

```
Done. ~/customers/<CustomerName>/demos/demo-flows.md written.

Track: <A/B/C/D> (<complexity level>)
Prompts: <prompt 1 short name> → <prompt 2> [→ <prompt 3>]
Why: <one sentence — the primary signal that drove selection>
```
